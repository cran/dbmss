Description: Simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects, including classical ones (Ripley's K and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's Kd, Marcon and Puech's M). Relies on 'spatstat' for some core calculation.
