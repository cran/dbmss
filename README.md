dbmss is an R package for simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures
of mapped objects, including classical ones (Ripley's *K* and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists 
(Duranton and Overman's *Kd*, Marcon and Puech's *M*). Relies on spatstat for some core calculation.
