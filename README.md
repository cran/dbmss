dbmss is an R package for simple computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to characterize the spatial structures
of mapped objects, including classical ones (Ripley's *K* and others) and more recent ones used by spatial economists 
(Duranton and Overman's *Kd*, Marcon and Puech's *M*). Relies on spatstat for some core calculation.

# Vignettes

A quick [introduction](https://EricMarcon.github.io/dbmss/) is in `vignette("docs", "dbmss")`.

A full documentation is available in section section of the same vignette (Reference Guide).
It is a continuous update of the paper published in the Journal of Statistical Software ([Marcon et al., 2015](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067c03)).
