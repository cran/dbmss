  abstract = {The question of measuring and testing industrial spatial concentration
	based on micro-geographic data with distance based methods has been
	addressed by Arbia (1996), Espa et al.(2010), Duranton-Overman (2005)
	and Marcon-Puech (2010). We discuss the basic requirements for such
	measures introduced by Duranton and Overman (2005) and we propose
	four additional requirements. We also discuss the null assumptions
	classically used for testing aggregation of a particular sector and
	propose an alternative point of view. The mathematical framework
	we use is based on some second order characteristics of marked spatial
	point processes discussed in Illian et al. (2008). The general index
	measure involves a cumulative and a non-cumulative version. This
	allows us to propose an alternative version of the Duranton-Overman
	index with a proper baseline as well as a cumulative version of this
	same index.},
